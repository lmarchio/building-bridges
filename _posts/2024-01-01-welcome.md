Hello! At the Quadram Institute Bioscience (QIB) we are excited to announce a series of initiative aimed at re-establishing collaborative partnerships with leading European research institutes. By investing in our scientists and in our project/programme/grants managers capabilities, we aim to unlock access to EU funding streams and cutting-edge research opportunities with counterparts at top European institutes working in areas aligned with our expertise in nutrition, microbiome, and food safety.

On 13-14 June, we will be hosting a workshop focused on Horizon Europe, the EU's flagship research and innovation programme. This event will provide insights into the funding landscape, key priorities, and strategies for successful proposal development. 

In July, we will host a cutting-edge workshop on harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) for grant writing. In an era where innovation and efficiency are paramount, AI tools can revolutionise the way we approach funding applications.

Our events are hybrid (we learnt our lesson from Covid), so if you work in a European Insitution where research insterest are aligned with ours, get in touch if you want to jon the events, please get in touch and if places are available, we'll welcome you and we'll share the opportunity to engage with experts, network with us (we are scientist and support staff - project/programme/partnership/grants managers, project officers and assistants), and gain the knowledge and skills necessary to secure substantial EU funding for your research.
