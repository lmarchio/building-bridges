## What is nf-core?

[nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) is a community effort to collect a curated set of analysis pipelines built using Nextflow.
The pipelines are developed and maintained by the community and are designed to be highly reusable, scalable, and reproducible.

## What is this hackathon about?

The hackathon is being held in a virtual venue on the platform *[Gather](https://nf-co.re/events/2022/bytesize-37-gathertown)*.

[QIB](https://www.quadram.ac.uk) is hosting a local site for the event,
and we are looking for participants to join us in the hackathon.

The hackathon is a great opportunity to work on any nf-core related work that you have been putting off or didnâ€™t have time for. To help you find like-minded people or possible things to work on, we will have the following topics (formally known as groups).
