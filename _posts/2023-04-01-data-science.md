## What

How to use [**Benchdamic**](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/benchdamic.html)
to analyse a microbiome dataset.

## Who

[Dr Matteo Calgaro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6yCSQe8AAAAJ&hl=en)
is a bio statistician, who focussed his research on the development of statistical methods for the analysis of microbiome data.
During his PhD he evaluated the performance of different methods for the **normalization** of count tables (OTU Tables),
and then on methods for **differential abundance analysis**.

He developed the [**Benchdamic**](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/benchdamic.html)
package to assess which methods for differentiali abundance analyses perform better on a specific dataset.
