## Structural Bioinformatics Seminar

A seminar on structural bioinformatics 

## When, where

May 8th, 2024, Quadram Institute Bioscience, Norwich

UG55B Lecture Theatre, 14:00-15:15

*Open discussion and networking after the seminar*

## Who

Dr. [Dr Nicola Bordin](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6568-9035) did his Bachelorâ€™s and Master in Biotechnology and Industrial Biotechnology at the University of Padua (Italy) with both dissertations in the fields of structural bioinformatics and functional genomics. He completed his PhD in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics on functional genomics in PVC bacteria at the Universidad Pablo de Olavide in Seville, Spain, under the supervision of Dr. Damien Devos. His fields of expertise are in algorithm design for protein function prediction, structure classification, sequence analyses and machine learning applied to protein data. 

He is currently a senior researcher in the CATH team at [University College London](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/71445-nicola-bordin), where he develops novel algorithms for the functional classification of proteins, structural classification of AlphaFold domains in CATH, and applications of CATH data to various biological questions in cancer, megaphages, plastic degrading enzymes and SARS-CoV-2 host range in animals.
