## What

An introductory **seminar**, with a focus on the methodologies and a practical workshop by
[**Dr Giovanni Birolo**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kq8AdTAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao),
a mathematician turned computational biologist with experience in human and crop genetics and genomics, and now working on AI and ML approaches to predict outcomes from various biological datasets.

## When

* March 5th, 2024 (seminar)
* March 7th, 2024 (workshop)

### Seminar “What is machine learning and should you care?” 

* 5 March 2024, UG55B-C at 14.30

An overview of what happens in genetic studies applying repectively: unsupervised methods (e.g. PCA which results in the genetic structure of the population being resolved),  statistical tests (GWAS, to map genes to phenotypes) and prediction methods (e.g. polygenic scores)

### Workshop “An introduction to machine learning with Python” 

* 7 March 2024, UGUG55B at 14.30 ([**registration link**](https://intranet.nbi.ac.uk/infoserv/cgi-bin/calendar/default.asp?mid=0))
  
We will use a microbiome dataset to see how to import in python observations (microbiome compositions) and metadata, how to plot a PCA, perform a statistical test to identify interesting taxa, and using a machine learning approach, the Random Forest (already introduced at the Data Science group), to classify our samples.
