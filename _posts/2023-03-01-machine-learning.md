## What

An introductory **seminar**, with a focus on the methodologies and a practical workshop by
[**Dr Giovanni Birolo**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kq8AdTAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

Giovanni Birolo is a staff scientist at the Medical Science Department of the University of Turin.
Originally trained as a mathematician at the University of Padua, he earned his Ph.D. in mathematical logic before making a not completely deliberate transition to bioinformatics and genomics.
During his postdoctoral life, he delved into population genomics, biostatistics, and biomedical data analysis. 
In the last years he focused on **machine learning and prediction in medicine**.

## When

* March 5th, 2024 (seminar)
* March 7th, 2024 (workshop)

### Seminar “What is machine learning and should you care?” 

* 5 March 2024, UG55B-C at 14.30

An overview of what happens in genetic studies applying repectively: unsupervised methods (e.g. PCA which results in the genetic structure of the population being resolved),  statistical tests (GWAS, to map genes to phenotypes) and prediction methods (e.g. polygenic scores)

### Workshop “An introduction to machine learning with Python” 

* 7 March 2024, UGUG55B at 14.30 ([**registration link**](https://intranet.nbi.ac.uk/infoserv/cgi-bin/calendar/default.asp?id=66032))
  
We will use a microbiome dataset to see how to import in python observations (microbiome compositions) and metadata, how to plot a PCA, perform a statistical test to identify interesting taxa, and using a machine learning approach, the Random Forest (already introduced at the Data Science group), to classify our samples.
