At the Quadram Institute Bioscience (QIB) we believe in the power of collaborations, at every level. Collaborations among researchers are as important as collaborations among support staff members to create an environment where everyone feels valued and empowered. 
The "Building Bridges" adventure starts with an International Partnering Scheme at QIB. By investing in our scientific expertise and in our project/programme/grants/partnership management capabilities, we aim to unlock the potential of cooperative research with leading European Insitutions and foster strategic scientific partnerships. This endeavour aims to equip our staff (scientists and support staff) with skills in cross-continental collaboration while positioning QIB as an attractive UK partner for EU consortia.
Join us on this transformative journey as we offer opportunities for scientists, project managers, programme coordinators, grants managers, and support staff to expand their expertise, learn new ways to support each other, access world-class collaborations, and contribute to groundbreaking research projects.
