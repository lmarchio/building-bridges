At the Quadram Institute Bioscience (QIB) we believe in the power of collaborations, at every level. Collaborations among researchers are as important as collaborations among support staff members to support an environment where everyone's talents can flourish. We started this "Building Bridges" adventure thanks to an International Partnering Scheme; by investing in our project/programme/grants/partnership management capabilities and fostering strategic scientific partnerships, we aim to unlock the immense potential of cooperative research with leading European Insitutions. This endeavour aims to equip our talented staff (scientists and support staff) with cutting-edge skills in cross-continental collaboration while positioning QIB as an attractive UK partner for EU consortia.
Join us on this transformative journey as we offer unparalleled opportunities for scientists, project managers, programme managers, grants managers, and support staff to expand their expertise, learn new ways to support each other, access world-class infrastructure, and contribute to groundbreaking research projects.
