# Core Bioinfo Workshops 2024

Workshops coordinated by the **Core Bioinformatics** team at the [Quadram Institute Bioscience](https://quadram.ac.uk/).

### Theme used

Millennial is a minimalist Jekyll theme for running a simple, clean, content-focused publishing platform for your publication site or blog through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), or on your own server. Everything that you will ever need to know about this Jekyll theme is included in the README below, which you can also find in [the demo site](https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/). For a guide on how to deploy a Jekyll site using GitHub Pages, please check out [this article](https://paulle.ca/jekyll-tutorials/deploy-jekyll-site-github-pages).
